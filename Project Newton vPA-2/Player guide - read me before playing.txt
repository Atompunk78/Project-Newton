[This readme is for the vPA-2 pre-alpha version of Project Newton by Henry Gurney, released on the 28th October, 2022.]



Hi! I hope you enjoy the game, just a couple quick notes and some pointers before you play :)

Firstly and quickly, please don't share this game without explicit permission from Henry Gurney. This is an otherwise-unreleased pre-alpha version only intended for my close friends, a complete 1.0 full-release version will be released soon for anyone else that might want to play this.



Now, some quick pointers/advice:

You primarily move the character by shooting (left click) in the opposite direction of intended travel.

The player has 3 lives, eg on the third hit they die. The player blinks pink when one life is lost, and red when two are lost (indicating one more hit will end the game).

Each enemy turret has 4 lives, and will flash darker grey depending on how many lives they've lost.

A boost (right click) is available when your backpack turns blue, this gives a big boost against the faced direction to help stop moving or avoid a bullet!

The single level is quite short but quite difficult - more are coming soon so sit tight until then!

Importantly, you can tell when enemies are near by looking out for wires and control boxes, as they usually connect to an enemy.



One last thing, thankyou so much for playing! It means a lot and I really hope you enjoy it, even if this is just the pre-release version.

Good luck and have fun! :)

Boost added.
