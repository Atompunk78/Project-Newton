[This readme is for the first pre-release alpha version of Project Newton, released on the 27th October, 2022.]



Hi! I hope you enjoy the game, just a couple quick notes and some pointers before you play :)

Firstly and quickly, please don't share this game without explicit permission from Henry Gurney. This is a pre-release alpha version only intended for my close friends, a complete 1.0 full-release version will be released soon for anyone else that might want to play this.



Now, some quick pointers/advice:

The player has 3 lives, eg on the third hit they die. The player blinks pink when one life is lost, and red when two are lost (indicating one more hit will end the game).

Each enemy turret has 5 lives, and will flash darker grey depending on how many lives they've lost.

The single level is very short, but quite difficult - more are coming soon, so sit tight until then!



One last thing, thankyou so much for playing! It means a lot and I really hope you enjoy it, even if this is just the pre-release version.

Good luck and have fun! :)
